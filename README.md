### What is it?
Relics Info is a handy app that goes along with Warframe. Its main objective is to provide players with convenient access to warframe.market prices for all fissure rewards, making it effortless for them to select the best reward.
### How it works?
Here's how it works: Relics Info captures a screenshot of the game and utilizes Tesseract, an OCR engine, to recognize the text present in the screenshot. Once the OCR engine identifies the text, we extract the specific part names from it. Afterwards, we display the corresponding statistics for each part either within on a separate window. It's a process that enhances the overall gaming experience!
